# Final Capstone

Capstone tasks are a part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp and demonstrate some of the work I have done to craft well functioning and readable code.

### Installation

Download Python if you don't already have it installed on your system. Then come back here and download the files from the main directory.


### Usage

Once you have followed the standard installation, you can run the code on Visual Studio / Terminal / any other Python launcher. Here are a few side notes while using the files.


**Capstone one**:   This will work standalone and does not require any management to get this working. 

See this link for a screenshot of the code in action: 


**Capstone two**:    For Capstone two, this requires the other files **tasks.txt** and **user.txt** in order for the code to run. These are available to download in the same area. Ensure your code browser has these files in the same folder to setup. Recommended that these are run in Visual Studio.
