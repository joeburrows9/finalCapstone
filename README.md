# Final Capstone

Capstone tasks are a part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp and demonstrate some of the work I have done to craft well functioning and readable code.

### Installation

Download Python if you don't already have it installed on your system. Then come back here and download the files from the main directory.


### Usage

Once you have followed the standard installation, you can run the code on Visual Studio / Terminal / any other Python launcher. Here are a few side notes while using the files.


Read a brief summary of each assignment below:



## Capstone One
### Finance Calculations

**Usage**
This will work standalone and does not require any management to get this working. 

See ([this link](https://ibb.co/ykwHJV1)) for a screenshot of the code in action.

**Description**
This task is a calculator for Investment or Bond interest total repayments. The user enters their amount to pay then inputs the details in relation to the payments - the program then outputs how long it will take them to pay back and the total interest.



## Capstone Two
### Task Manager

**Usage**
This requires the other files **tasks.txt** and **user.txt** in order for the code to run. These are available to download in the same area. Ensure your code browser has these files in the same folder to setup. Recommended that these are run in Visual Studio.

See ([this link](https://ibb.co/P1xZ6r5)) for a screenshot of the code in action.

**Description**
This allows the user to manage tasks, to mark them as complete and enter the due date. User has the option to enter a description which can be edited, as can the user who is assigned to the task. Data is entered into a .txt document and can be exported using the program.
